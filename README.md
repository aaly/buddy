Buddy is a my cyberphysical responsive intelligent RT  assistant.

Some doodling here....

It is built on top of follow-me.

ðŸŽ¯ I'm aiming at the following outcomes
* Learn about local LLM agents.
* Do some embedded system design.
* Enjoy delivering some value that is personal to me.


I'm trading my time, wealth (^_^;) and health for FUN (-> goes back to health <-), so Fun must be guranteed!
